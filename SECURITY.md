# Security Policy

## 🔒 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

The GLIN team takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

### **Please DO NOT** open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, report security issues via email to:

**security@glin.network**

### What to Include in Your Report

To help us triage and fix the issue quickly, please include:

1. **Description** of the vulnerability
2. **Steps to reproduce** the issue
3. **Potential impact** (what can an attacker do?)
4. **Suggested fix** (if you have one)
5. **Your contact information** for follow-up

### Example Report

```
Subject: [SECURITY] Reentrancy vulnerability in GenericEscrow

Description:
The approve_and_release function in GenericEscrow contract
is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks because it transfers
funds before updating state.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Deploy malicious contract with fallback function
2. Call approve_and_release() as client
3. Fallback function calls approve_and_release() again
4. Funds are released twice

Impact:
High - Can drain contract funds

Suggested Fix:
Move transfer() call after state updates or add reentrancy guard

Contact: your-email@example.com
```

## 🎯 Bug Bounty Program

We offer rewards for security vulnerabilities based on severity:

| Severity | Bounty | Examples |

| **Critical** | $5,000 - $10,000 | Fund theft, unauthorized minting, complete DoS |
| **High** | $2,000 - $5,000 | Griefing attacks, partial DoS, authorization bypass |
| **Medium** | $500 - $2,000 | Information disclosure, gas manipulation |
| **Low** | $100 - $500 | Best practice violations, minor issues |

### In Scope

- ✅ All contracts in this repository
- ✅ Storage manipulation vulnerabilities
- ✅ Arithmetic errors (overflow/underflow)
- ✅ Access control issues
- ✅ Reentrancy vulnerabilities
- ✅ Logic errors leading to fund loss
- ✅ DoS vulnerabilities

### Out of Scope

- ❌ Issues in third-party dependencies
- ❌ Theoretical vulnerabilities without PoC
- ❌ Issues already reported
- ❌ Social engineering attacks
- ❌ Physical attacks on infrastructure
- ❌ Issues in test contracts

### Eligibility

To be eligible for a bounty:

1. Report must be original (not already known)
2. Provide working proof-of-concept
3. Allow reasonable time for fixing (90 days)
4. Do not exploit the vulnerability
5. Do not publicly disclose before fix

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### For Contract Developers

When building on GLIN contracts:

1. **Always validate inputs**
   ```rust
   if amount == 0 {
       return Err(Error::InvalidAmount);
   }
   ```

2. **Use checked arithmetic**
   ```rust
   let result = balance.checked_add(amount)
       .ok_or(Error::Overflow)?;
   ```

3. **Follow Checks-Effects-Interactions**
   ```rust
   // 1. Check
   ensure_authorized()?;

   // 2. Effect
   self.balance -= amount;

   // 3. Interaction
   self.env().transfer(recipient, amount)?;
   ```

4. **Emit events for critical actions**
   ```rust
   self.env().emit_event(FundsReleased {
       to: recipient,
       amount,
   });
   ```

5. **Set reasonable limits**
   ```rust
   const MAX_MILESTONES: u32 = 100;
   if milestones.len() > MAX_MILESTONES {
       return Err(Error::TooManyMilestones);
   }
   ```

### For Contract Users

1. **Verify contract code** before interaction
2. **Use trusted frontends** only
3. **Double-check transaction details** before signing
4. **Start with small amounts** when testing
5. **Keep private keys secure**

## 🔍 Security Audits

### Completed Audits

| Date | Auditor | Scope | Report |
|------|---------|-------|--------|
| Coming Soon | TBD | All contracts | TBD |

### Audit Scope

Our audits cover:

- ✅ Logic errors and edge cases
- ✅ Access control vulnerabilities
- ✅ Arithmetic overflow/underflow
- ✅ Reentrancy attacks
- ✅ DoS vulnerabilities
- ✅ Front-running risks
- ✅ Gas optimization
- ✅ Best practice compliance

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **No formal verification** - Contracts have not been formally verified
2. **Limited battle-testing** - Early stage, use with caution
3. **Gas costs** - May be high for complex operations
4. **No upgrade mechanism** - Contracts are immutable once deployed

### Recommended Mitigations

- Start with testnet deployment
- Use small amounts initially
- Monitor contract events
- Have backup plans for locked funds

## 📋 Security Checklist for Deployments

Before deploying to mainnet:

- [ ] All tests pass (`cargo test`)
- [ ] No compiler warnings (`cargo clippy`)
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Gas costs estimated
- [ ] Access controls verified
- [ ] Event emission tested
- [ ] Edge cases covered
- [ ] Testnet deployment successful
- [ ] Documentation updated

## 🚨 Incident Response

If a vulnerability is discovered in production:

1. **Immediate Assessment** (0-2 hours)
   - Confirm vulnerability
   - Assess impact
   - Determine if funds at risk

2. **Mitigation** (2-24 hours)
   - Deploy fixes if possible
   - Pause affected functions
   - Communicate with users

3. **Resolution** (1-7 days)
   - Full fix deployment
   - User compensation if needed
   - Post-mortem report

4. **Prevention** (ongoing)
   - Update security practices
   - Additional testing
   - Process improvements
